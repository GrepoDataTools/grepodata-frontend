    <h2 class="gd-primary">Why do I need a GrepoData account?</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
      A GrepoData account is required to guarantee the security of the intel you collect and the people you share it with.
      This way, the admin of a GrepoData team can manage exactly who has access to the intel and can revoke their access whenever needed.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Privacy is very important to us. Your username is visible to all GrepoData users but your email address will always remain private and will only be used to authenticate you when you wish to reset your password.
      At any time, you are able to completely delete your account from our database. Read more in our <a routerLink="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.

          2. <strong>Browsing:</strong> The extracted enemy intelligence from the report is linked to your personal GrepoData account.
          This allows you to browse the collected intel using the in-game town intel view or by signing in here.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          3. <strong>Sharing:</strong> If you are a member of a GrepoData team and if you enable contributions to that team, the report you just indexed will also be shared with your allies as long as they also have access to that team.

    <h2 class="gd-primary">What is a GrepoData team?</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
      A <strong>team</strong> is a collection of enemy intelligence. Anyone can create a new team and invite others to join their team.
      The members of a team can then choose to contribute the reports they collect to the team. All members of the team will also be able to browse this intel.
      <br/>
      Our recommendation is that you create a team together with your alliance. This way, you can work together to gather enemy intelligence.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Before April 2021, a team used to be known as an 'index'. Teams are the replacement of the old index system, but their functionality is still very similar.

    <h2 class="gd-primary">What type of reports are collected?</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
      Currently our userscript allows you to collect published reports that are posted on your alliance forum or sent to you in a personal message.
      Reports from your personal reports inbox can also be indexed without publishing them.
      Converted reports from other third party tools can not be indexed.

    <h2 class="gd-primary">Is my data secure?</h2>
    <div class="faq-content">
      The newly updated GrepoData city indexer tool was developed with data security as it's number one priority. Above all else, data must be stored securely and team admins must have absolute authority over who has access to the team's intel & data.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>Data protection</strong><br/>
      We take data protection very seriously. All sensitive user data is stored using industry standard best practices.
      Even in the unlikely event that an unauthorized person gains access to this data; they would be unable to parse the hashed data they would find.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <strong>GrepoData team security</strong><br/>
      As an admin or owner of a team, you can add or remove users from the team at any time.
      Only active members of the team will have access to the information in the team.
      Once you remove a user, they will nog longer be able to access the collected intel from your team.
      Any intel that they collected themselves will still be available to them.
