				Our service will then analyse the report to extract enemy intelligence and add it to your index.
				You and your allies can then browse the collected intel on grepodata.com or in-game as can be seen in the figure on the right.

				<br/>
				If you want to browse intel while in-game, you need to install the userscript for that index.
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<strong>Note:</strong> You should install the userscript again for each new index you want to use. You can have multiple userscripts installed at the same time.

	<div class="faq-content">
		<p>Our script does not automate any gameplay elements, and therefore is in compliance with the overall rules.</p>
		<br/>
		The script has official approval on the following servers:
		<ul>
			<li>
				<mat-icon class="icon-margin"><div class="bg-flag flag-nl"></div></mat-icon>
				<a href="https://wiki.nl.grepolis.com/wiki/Scripts">nl</a></li>
		</ul>

		<br/>Approval on other servers is <strong>pending since 2018</strong>. Unfortunately, Grepolis is currently not evaluating new scripts due to limitations on available developers. However, using our script will not get you banned. <a href="https://en.forum.grepolis.com/index.php?threads/grepodata-enemy-city-indexer-pending-approval.62245/#post-1057206" target="_blank">You can find more info about this here.</a>

	<div class="faq-content">
		Currently our userscript allows you to collect published reports that are posted on your alliance forum or sent to you in a personal message.
		Reports from your reports inbox can also be indexed without publishing them.
		Converted reports from other third party tools can not yet be indexed.

	<div class="faq-content">
		Your index key is only available to you and anyone you choose to share the link with. If you suspect your index has been leaked you can easily request a new key to once again secure the index by using the red button in the top right corner of your index homepage.
		<br/><br/>
		We actively keep track of bots and crawlers to prevent unauthorized users to gain access to your index. Please keep in mind that you will be temporarily banned if you try to find unknown index keys.

	<div class="faq-content">
		The more players use your index userscript, the more intel will be collected. You should encourage your alliance members to also use the script in order to maximize the collected intel.
		If you wish to collect your own intel, you need to create a new private index and install the userscript that comes with it.
		If you create a new index, you need to install the unique userscript that comes with it.

	<div class="faq-content">
		You can install multiple userscripts (for different indexes) at the same time; you don't have to uninstall the userscript to install a new script.
		<br/>
		If you do want to uninstall an old script, navigate to the Tampermonkey dashboard by clicking on the Tampermonkey icon in the top right,
		and then clicking on 'Dashboard'. Find the script you want to uninstall in this list and remove it from Tampermonkey.

	<div class="faq-content">
		No. The automatic background upload has been removed from the script as it is against the rules of Grepolis.
		Automated functionality is not allowed in userscripts. Using such a script will result in an in-game ban of your account when you are detected.
